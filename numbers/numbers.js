//  JavaScript only has one type of numbers
//  Numbers can be written with or without decimals - for example...

var num = 32; // Integers are numbers - integers are very precise (up to 15 digits)
var decNum = 32.5; // Decimals are numbers - not always accurate (max num of decimal places is 17)

//  Numbers do not have quotes around them!
//  Number do follow standard rules of operations
//  You can perform operations on numbers, like this...

console.log(10 + 5); // 15
console.log((8 * (96 - 2)) / 2); // 376

//  Write your own number variables - do some fancy math while your at it! be sure to console log the statements
