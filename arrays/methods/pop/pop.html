        When working with arrays, it is easy to insert and remove items from
        them, this is what is known as pushing and popping, in this lesson we
        are going to look at the pop() method more specifically. Let's take a
        look below and see what what's going down...
      </p>
      <p>
        The pop() method literally removes and returns the last element from an
        array, meaning that this method will mutate the original array, check it
        out...
      </p>
      <p>
        The original array looks like this...<strong>
          const favBands = [ "Metalllica", "Red Hot Chili Peppers", "Rolling
          Stones" ];</strong
        >
      </p>
      <div class="row">
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Output of using pop() on favBand array...
        </p>
        <div id="demo" class="col"></div>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;">
          Output of favBand array after we use the pop() method...
        </p>
        <div id="demo1"></div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <script>
      // In order to pop we first must have an array
      const favBands = [
        "Metalllica",
        "Red Hot Chili Peppers",
        "Rolling Stones"
      ];
      // To removes and returns the last element of an array we use the pop() method like so...
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = favBands.pop();

      document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = favBands;
      console.log(favBands);

      // We can also do fun things like assign the 'popped' element from the array a variable and then reuse it any way we would like...let's take a look at some examples

      let newArr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
      let lastEle = newArr.pop();
      console.log(lastEle); // return 6
      newArr[0] = lastEle; // replace first element of newArr with lastEle
      console.log(newArr); // return [6,2,3,4,5]
    </script>
  </body>
