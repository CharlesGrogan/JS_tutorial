// toString method coverts an array to a string of (comma seperated) array values, example....

const heros = ["Thor", "IronMan", "Hulk"];
console.log(heros.toString()); // return Thor,IronMan,Hulk

// This is a pretty straight forward method - the main purpose of using this function is when there is work to be done on an array that is easier/more efficient to perform in string form.
